# Agricultural-Soil-Quality-Prediction-using-ML

Overview:
The "Agricultural Soil Quality Prediction using Machine Learning" project aims to predict soil quality based on various soil attributes. By analyzing factors like nitrogen levels, pH, and organic carbon content, machine learning models are trained to classify soil quality. This project has the potential to optimize crop production and inform soil management practices.

Models Used:
Logistic Regression
Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Outcome:
Developed predictive models for soil quality classification.
Enhanced crop production through informed soil management practices.
Contributed to sustainable agriculture and food security.

Why This Project?
Helps farmers optimize crop yield and improve soil health.
Provides valuable insights for sustainable agricultural practices.
Contributes to food security by ensuring efficient use of resources.
